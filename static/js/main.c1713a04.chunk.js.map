That's not what we aim for. On prooph board it should be possible to design software together. Hence, we redesigned the Cody Wizard, so that it integrates seamlessly into the collaboration workflow. You'll notice that Cody appears on the collaboration space to suggest Cards. Cody also found a way into the toolbar. A click will open the metadata sidebar, which has a new \"Cody\" tab.

Who wrote that card and when? Now you can answer such questions with the new \"Activity\" tab in the metadata sidebar.
