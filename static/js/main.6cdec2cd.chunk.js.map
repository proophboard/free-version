For this, an Event Modeling Mode has been introduced. It's activated by default for all new boards. You can activate the mode for an existing board in the board settings. In Event Modeling mode feature frames become \"Slices\" with typical Event Modeling swim lanes. Cody suggestions are also tuned to place cards in the correct lanes. Cody looks for slices and only provides suggestions for cards that are in a Slice. The card types itself are the same and Cody Play and Cody Engine continue to work as before. With the next updates we'll make a few more backwards compatible changes to further align with ideas from Event Modeling. Tell us if you like or don't like the direction we are heading to! We hope, you'll jump on the Event Modeling train and do the journey together with us!\n            </p>\n        </>\n},\n{\ndate: '2023-11-20',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>Playshots</MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                So far, it was only possible to save Cody Play in the browser's local storage.

Cody reads the schema of a data structure from the metadata of Information/Command/Event Cards. You can define the schema in the metadata sidebar. That works good when working alone on an Event Map. In an Event Storming session it is better to use Information Cards for all properties of a data structure. This way, it is easier to collaborate as a group. Now you can combine both approaches. First brainstorm with Information Cards, then drag & drop them on Commands, Events or other Information Cards to let Cody fill the schema from dropped Information Cards.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2023-11-16',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>Disable Cody Suggestions</MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                Cody Suggestions are useful for Design-Level Event Storming. Cody helps you to prepare the Event Map for Cody Play or Cody Engine. But it can get in your way on architecture or high-level boards. Therefor, we added an option to deactivate Cody Suggestions.

To achieve that goal, a browser-only version of Cody Engine is now available. You can use it for ultra rapid prototyping. No installation needed, no servers, nothing that might get in the way between you and the feedback-loop. It's hosted on <a href=\"https://play.prooph-board.com\" target=\"cody_play\">https://play.prooph-board.com</a>. prooph board can connect to Cody Play by using <strong>/connect play</strong> in the Cody Console. However, the easiest way is to run Cody from the Cody Wizard (modal or metadata sidebar). You'll find a new <strong>run on:</strong> dropdown that let's you select the Cody environment. The default setting is <strong>auto</strong>, which means that Cody Wizard first tries to connect to a locally running Cody Engine and if that fails switches to Cody Play.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2023-09-23',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                improophed Cody Wizard (beta)\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                We ran a couple of design sessions using the new Cody Wizard and while it is working great, we noticed one drawback: the Cody Wizard forces you to leave the collaboration space and switch to a configuration-driven workflow. That's not what we aim for. On prooph board it should be possible to design software together. Hence, we redesigned the Cody Wizard, so that it integrates seamlessly into the collaboration workflow. You'll notice that Cody appears on the collaboration space to suggest Cards. Cody also found a way into the toolbar. A click will open the metadata sidebar, which has a new \"Cody\" tab. Everything you could do in the Cody Wizard is now possible as a combination of Cody suggestions on the collaboration space + settings in the Cody tab.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2023-08-21',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Element Activity\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                You might know the board activity sidebar, that you can open from the board top menu.

Who wrote that card and when? Now you can answer such questions with the new \"Activity\" tab in the metadata sidebar.

You can change sort direction by clicking on the sort icon. A team dropdown lets you quickly filter all boards of a team. Your sort and filter settings are stored in the browser's local storage. Additionally, board search supports tags now. Add tags to existing boards on the board edit page or in the advanced settings while adding a new board.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2022-01-31',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Rearranged Editing Toolbar\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Moved \"font color\" into main toolbar</li>\n                    <li>Moved \"background color\" into main toolbar</li>\n                    <li>Moved \"clear formatting\" into align menu</li>\n                    <li>Removed formatting menu</li>\n                    <li>Added a \"wiki link\" button</li>\n                </ul>\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2021-11-20',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                More Styling Options\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                New styling options are available for advanced modelling and different workshop formats.

We disabled a couple of fade in/out animations in favor of performance and added a little physics effect when moving a board around. The latter gives a more natural feeling to compensate the deactivated fade effects. The Lite Mode still gives you best performance in case your system is under heavy load, but you should less likely have a need to activate it.</p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2021-11-02',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Synchronized Timer\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>You'll find a new timer feature in the board top menu (click on the hour glass icon).
