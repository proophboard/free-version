You can change sort direction by clicking on the sort icon. A team dropdown lets you quickly filter all boards of a team. Your sort and filter settings are stored in the browser's local storage. Additionally, board search supports tags now. Add tags to existing boards on the board edit page or in the advanced settings while adding a new board.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2022-01-31',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Rearranged Editing Toolbar\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Moved \"font color\" into main toolbar</li>\n                    <li>Moved \"background color\" into main toolbar</li>\n                    <li>Moved \"clear formatting\" into align menu</li>\n                    <li>Removed formatting menu</li>\n                    <li>Added a \"wiki link\" button</li>\n                </ul>\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2021-11-20',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                More Styling Options\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                New styling options are available for advanced modelling and different workshop formats.

We disabled a couple of fade in/out animations in favor of performance and added a little physics effect when moving a board around. The latter gives a more natural feeling to compensate the deactivated fade effects. The Lite Mode still gives you best performance in case your system is under heavy load, but you should less likely have a need to activate it.</p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2021-11-02',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Synchronized Timer\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>You'll find a new timer feature in the board top menu (click on the hour glass icon).
