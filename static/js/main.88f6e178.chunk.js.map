That's not what we aim for. On prooph board it should be possible to design software together. Hence, we redesigned the Cody Wizard, so that it integrates seamlessly into the collaboration workflow. You'll notice that Cody appears on the collaboration space to suggest Cards. Cody also found a way into the toolbar. A click will open the metadata sidebar, which has a new \"Cody\" tab. Everything you could do in the Cody Wizard is now possible as a combination of Cody suggestions on the collaboration space + settings in the Cody tab.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2023-08-21',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Element Activity\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                You might know the board activity sidebar, that you can open from the board top menu. It shows the history of each action done on the board. While this is useful to get an overview of what happened, it's not that easy to find actions related to a specific element. Who wrote that card and when? Now you can answer such questions with the new \"Activity\" tab in the metadata sidebar. Select a card, open the sidebar from the top or context menu and switch to the tab to get activity filtered by the selected card.\n            </p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2023-07-16',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Cody wizard (beta)\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>\n                prooph board and Cody are a powerful combination for code assistance.

Cody Engine is a ready-to-use, open source application stack to support cross-functional teams in product development. And the new integrated \"Cody Wizard\" is the counterpart on prooph board to boost Design-Level Event Storming and prepare everything for Cody to generate fully working application source code. You can start the wizard by right clicking on a card on the board and selecting \"Cody Wizard\" from the context menu. The wizard is available as a beta version at the moment.

We disabled a couple of fade in/out animations in favor of performance and added a little physics effect when moving a board around. The latter gives a more natural feeling to compensate the deactivated fade effects. The Lite Mode still gives you best performance in case your system is under heavy load, but you should less likely have a need to activate it.</p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2021-11-02',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Synchronized Timer\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>You'll find a new timer feature in the board top menu (click on the hour glass icon).
