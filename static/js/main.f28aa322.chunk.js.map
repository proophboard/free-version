With this update, we are moving Swimlanes into a dedicated element (available in sidebar) and bring the feature boxes back. The Swimlanes element is similar to a Context box and is the container for an entire Event Model (or part of it). With the feature boxes back in the game, you can mark Vertical Slices of the Event Model.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2024-03-04',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>Draggable Tree View Elements</MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        You can now drag elements from the Tree View in the left sidebar on the board.

For this, an Event Modeling Mode has been introduced. It's activated by\n        default for all new boards. You can activate the mode for an existing board in the board settings. In Event\n        Modeling mode feature frames become \"Slices\" with typical Event Modeling swim lanes. Cody suggestions are also\n        tuned to place cards in the correct lanes. Cody looks for slices and only provides suggestions for cards that\n        are in a Slice. The card types itself are the same and Cody Play and Cody Engine continue to work as before.\n        With the next updates we'll make a few more backwards compatible changes to further align with ideas from Event\n        Modeling.

Cody reads the schema of a data\n        structure from the metadata of Information/Command/Event Cards. You can define the schema in the metadata\n        sidebar. That works good when working alone on an Event Map. In an Event Storming session it is better to use\n        Information Cards for all properties of a data structure. This way, it is easier to collaborate as a group. Now\n        you can combine both approaches. First brainstorm with Information Cards, then drag & drop them on Commands,\n        Events or other Information Cards to let Cody fill the schema from dropped Information Cards.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2023-11-16',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>Disable Cody Suggestions</MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        Cody Suggestions are useful for Design-Level Event Storming. Cody helps you to prepare the Event Map for Cody\n        Play or Cody Engine. But it can get in your way on architecture or high-level boards. Therefor, we added an\n        option to deactivate Cody Suggestions.

To achieve that goal, a browser-only\n        version of Cody Engine is now available. You can use it for ultra rapid prototyping. No installation needed, no\n        servers, nothing that might get in the way between you and the feedback-loop. It's hosted on <a\n        href=\"https://play.prooph-board.com\" target=\"cody_play\">https://play.prooph-board.com</a>. prooph board can\n        connect to Cody Play by using <strong>/connect play</strong> in the Cody Console. However, the easiest way is to\n        run Cody from the Cody Wizard (modal or metadata sidebar). You'll find a new <strong>run on:</strong> dropdown\n        that let's you select the Cody environment.

That's not what we aim for. On prooph board it should be possible to design software together. Hence,\n        we redesigned the Cody Wizard, so that it integrates seamlessly into the collaboration workflow. You'll notice\n        that Cody appears on the collaboration space to suggest Cards. Cody also found a way into the toolbar. A click\n        will open the metadata sidebar, which has a new \"Cody\" tab.
