We disabled a couple of fade in/out animations in favor of performance and added a little physics effect when moving a board around. The latter gives a more natural feeling to compensate the deactivated fade effects. The Lite Mode still gives you best performance in case your system is under heavy load, but you should less likely have a need to activate it.</p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2021-11-02',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Synchronized Timer\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>You'll find a new timer feature in the board top menu (click on the hour glass icon). Setting a timer enables it for all users on the current board. Everybody will see the time ticking and a red blinking timer, when the set time is over. This is especially useful for time-boxed collaboration sessions. The person who sets the timer has control over it (pause, stop, reset).</p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2021-02-13',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Direct Import\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>A new import functionality allows you to prepare a link that opens prooph board and imports a board fetched from an URL.
