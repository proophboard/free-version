You usually want to have the full story on a board, right? However, working on large Event Models can get slow due to the amount of elements a browser\n        can handle at once. We realized, that the present Lite Mode is not enough for really large models, so we did a rework to tackle the issues. If you now turn the <a href=\"https://wiki.prooph-board.com/board_workspace/Lite-Mode.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lite Mode</a> on,\n        you have to double click on a frame to show its details, and press Ctrl/Cmd + double click to hide the details again. The behavior is inspired by navigating a folder structure.\n        The effect is, that as long as you organize your Event Model using frames the Lite Mode can hide many elements and reduce the work the browser has to do while navigating on the board.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2024-07-10',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>Cody goes Event Modeling first</MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        The next major update has landed in prooph board. The whole Cody specific design and configuration as well as Cody Play is now focused on an Event Modeling first approach.\n        This means, that you can freely design your software using Event Modeling and in a second step make it work in Cody Play. No more design limitations to make Cody happy.\n        It can handle a whole new bunch of scenarios like information projections, pure command handlers, aggregateless events, and more. This update also marks the end of the Cody beta phase. We're going to work on the Cody Play tutorial and wiki next,\n        so that you get detailed instructions of how to develop prototypes and software with it.

The first update introduced Slices, which worked similar to Feature boxes, but had Swimlanes built-in. With this update, we are moving Swimlanes into a dedicated element (available in sidebar) and bring the feature boxes back. The Swimlanes element is similar to a Context box and is the container for an entire Event Model (or part of it). With the feature boxes back in the game, you can mark Vertical Slices of the Event Model.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2024-03-04',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>Draggable Tree View Elements</MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        You can now drag elements from the Tree View in the left sidebar on the board. Dragged elements are copied so\n        you're not moving the original element.

For this, an Event Modeling Mode has been introduced. It's activated by\n        default for all new boards. You can activate the mode for an existing board in the board settings. In Event\n        Modeling mode feature frames become \"Slices\" with typical Event Modeling swim lanes. Cody suggestions are also\n        tuned to place cards in the correct lanes. Cody looks for slices and only provides suggestions for cards that\n        are in a Slice. The card types itself are the same and Cody Play and Cody Engine continue to work as before.\n        With the next updates we'll make a few more backwards compatible changes to further align with ideas from Event\n        Modeling. Tell us if you like or don't like the direction we are heading to!

Cody reads the schema of a data\n        structure from the metadata of Information/Command/Event Cards. You can define the schema in the metadata\n        sidebar. That works good when working alone on an Event Map. In an Event Storming session it is better to use\n        Information Cards for all properties of a data structure. This way, it is easier to collaborate as a group. Now\n        you can combine both approaches. First brainstorm with Information Cards, then drag & drop them on Commands,\n        Events or other Information Cards to let Cody fill the schema from dropped Information Cards.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2023-11-16',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>Disable Cody Suggestions</MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        Cody Suggestions are useful for Design-Level Event Storming. Cody helps you to prepare the Event Map for Cody\n        Play or Cody Engine. But it can get in your way on architecture or high-level boards. Therefor, we added an\n        option to deactivate Cody Suggestions. You can find the option in the board settings.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2023-10-06',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>Cody Play</MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        We're striving for instant feedback-loops to avoid hand overs at all costs.

No installation needed, no\n        servers, nothing that might get in the way between you and the feedback-loop.

However, the easiest way is to\n        run Cody from the Cody Wizard (modal or metadata sidebar). You'll find a new <strong>run on:</strong> dropdown\n        that let's you select the Cody environment. The default setting is <strong>auto</strong>, which means that Cody\n        Wizard first tries to connect to a locally running Cody Engine and if that fails switches to Cody Play.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2023-09-23',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>\n        improophed Cody Wizard (beta)\n      </MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        We ran a couple of design sessions using the new Cody Wizard and while it is working great, we noticed one\n        drawback: the Cody Wizard forces you to leave the collaboration space and switch to a configuration-driven\n        workflow. That's not what we aim for. On prooph board it should be possible to design software together. Hence,\n        we redesigned the Cody Wizard, so that it integrates seamlessly into the collaboration workflow. You'll notice\n        that Cody appears on the collaboration space to suggest Cards. Cody also found a way into the toolbar. A click\n        will open the metadata sidebar, which has a new \"Cody\" tab. Everything you could do in the Cody Wizard is now\n        possible as a combination of Cody suggestions on the collaboration space + settings in the Cody tab.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2023-08-21',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>\n        Element Activity\n      </MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        You might know the board activity sidebar, that you can open from the board top menu. It shows the history of\n        each action done on the board. While this is useful to get an overview of what happened, it's not that easy to\n        find actions related to a specific element. Who wrote that card and when? Now you can answer such questions with\n        the new \"Activity\" tab in the metadata sidebar. Select a card, open the sidebar from the top or context menu and\n        switch to the tab to get activity filtered by the selected card.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  },\n  {\n    date: '2023-07-16',\n    content: <>\n      <MessageHeader>\n        Cody wizard (beta)\n      </MessageHeader>\n      <p>\n        prooph board and Cody are a powerful combination for code assistance.

And the new integrated \"Cody Wizard\" is the counterpart on prooph\n        board to boost Design-Level Event Storming and prepare everything for Cody to generate fully working application\n        source code. You can start the wizard by right clicking on a card on the board and selecting \"Cody Wizard\" from\n        the context menu. The wizard is available as a beta version at the moment.
