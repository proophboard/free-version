More zoom steps scale the font to a new maximum size of 300px. On existing boards this can lead to overlapping labels when Frames are too close together or are too small. It's not a big deal, but you might want to reorganise your boards to look nice again in the bird view.</p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2020-11-16',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Two-Click Gesture\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>We improved the behavior when clicking on an element in the board workspace sidebar. In the past, a click (instead of Drag & Drop) added the element on a random position on the board. That was a confusing behavior. If you click now, an insert mode is activated. The mouse cursor turns into the element you're going to insert. Choose the position on the board where you want to insert the element and click again to complete the insert action.</p>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Copy-on-click disabled\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>To connect two elements on the board, you have to drag one of the arrows next to an element and drop the connection on another element. This works fine, but the arrows had a second functionality. If you did not start dragging but simply clicking on an arrow, the source element was copied. We disabled that functionality, because many users accidentally copy elements and are confused by the result.</p>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Improved Realtime Synchronisation\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>If many users work together on a board realtime synchronisation ensures that all users see the same content on the board. As long as the network connection is stable this works fine, but unstable connections can lead to information loss. We added some advanced synchonisation strategies that can deal with temporally unavailable network connections. We will monitor the changes and improve them further if needed.</p>\n        </>\n    },\n    {\n        date: '2020-08-26',\n        content: <>\n            <MessageHeader>\n                Organize work on a board with layers\n            </MessageHeader>\n            <p>A few weeks ago we activated a first version of a feature called \"Layers\".

Turns out that layers are a very good addition to prooph board. They help you organize different activities on a team board. So we collected the feedback and integrated layers as a main functionality quickly accessible from the left sidebar on the board workspace and integrated in the context tree.

Card Metadata is supposed to help documenting technical details like message or data schema, API information, etc. Those details are placed in a new sidebar, accessible for everyone who is interested, but hidden from the main workspace.
